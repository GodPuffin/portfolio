# Offseason Swerve Drive
During the FRC offseason, I had the opportunity to mentor a group of students in building a brand new swerve drive mini bot, as a proof of concept for the robotics team.

## The CAD Design
The mini bot was designed using OnShape. The main design idea was to create a simple and small swerve drive base to establish the code and mechanical design for the main robot. It is made to have a very low part count and a low center of gravity.

## Building Progress
The students did most of the building while I supervised and provided guidance. The relatively simple parts being made for the frame means everything could be manufactured with hand tools, simple machines, and a 3D printer. It is worth mentioning that the swerve modules are off the shelf, allowing us to focus on the code and the frame. The REV MAXSwerve modules were picked for their low weight, low cost, and ease of use. The students were able to assemble the swerve modules and the frame in a few days, and we were able to move on to the code and testing.

## Testing and Iteration
To ensure the functionality and performance of our swerve drive, we conducted rigorous testing. We put the drivetrain through its paces, evaluating its maneuverability, speed, and responsiveness. This was used as a learning experience for the students, as they were able to see the results of their work and make adjustments to the code and the frame. The iterative process allowed us to refine the swerve drive's performance, making it more reliable and efficient.

## The Final Result

The final result of our offseason swerve drive project was truly remarkable. The video above showcases the swerve drive in action.

## Conclusion
The offseason swerve drive project was a great learning experience for the students and myself. It allowed us to explore new technologies and concepts, and it provided us with valuable insights that we can apply to the main robot. The swerve drive mini bot was a success, and it has set the stage for an exciting and innovative robotics season.
